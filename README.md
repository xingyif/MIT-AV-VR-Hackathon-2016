Design Challenge:

Project planning is difficult, whether designing a high-rise, developing software, or planning a family vacation Planning
for a design process in particular is especially challenging given the non-linear, iterative nature of ideation, testing,
and learning within the context of managing multiple objectives. Navigating and finding control within this "organized chaos"
gets even more difficult when multiple people are part of the planning and decision making process.

Thinking about the possibilities that VR and Mixed Reality can offer, we feel we are ready to move beyond 2D tools such
as Gantt charts and flow diagrams and have created a new 4D model to assist project planning and tracking that we call
the "Grapevine". It is collaborative at its core. To assure successful adoption, we realize it has to be simple, intuitive, and fun.

Design Solution:

Our solution addresses this complexity first and foremost by mapping or "modeling a spatial framework" for collaborative
design to take place within. This 3D shape is simple enough to be held in your hand and complex enough to walk through an
immersive and data-rich environment holding a robust record of key information, team decisions, and interrelated tasks. 
Think MS Project meets the Slinky.
Virtual Reality and Mixed Reality allows us not only to utilize a third dimension to better visualize these complex relationships,
but also to literally steps into the fourth dimension of time to allow us to remember and understand past decisions and plan 
for future outcomes. Our 4D model is crafted into the shape of a virtual cylindrical "corridor" Picture walking through a Slinky 
set in a straight path but with portions of the coils densely packed at times and more stretched out at other times. This shape 
can be scaled down to hold in your hand or hover above a conference table in a mixed reality environment or scaled-up to be able 
to walk through using a collaborative VR cave or with interconnected head-mounted displays.
This spiraling curving line defining the corridor, or "vine", serves a continuous project timeline. Attached along this vine are
nodes representing ideas that are born at a certain place along this timeline. Each node has its own unique linear timeline that 
exists for it's own lifespan.

As one travels forward through time within the project, initial ideas are revisited in an iterative fashion as the curved line of 
the overall project timeline intersects with straight lines of each idea's individual timeline.
To mention what may be obvious from our project's name, these idea nodes can be understood as grapes on the grapevine. 
To take the analogy further and to add a sense of play, it may be said that some ideas "die on the vine" and we wouldnâ€™t be surprised 
if one starts imitating Marvin Gaye as they transverse this virtual design space.
